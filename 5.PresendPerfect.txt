Tom is looking for his key. He can’t find it.
He has lost his key.
He has lost his key = He lost it recently, and he still
doesn't have it.
Have/has lost is the present perfect simple:

l/we/they/you have (= I've etc.)
he/she/it has (= he's etc.)
finished
lost
done
been etc.

I've read this book
I've not read this book
Have I read this book

The present perfect simple is have/has +past participle. The past participle often ends in -ed
(finished/decided etc.), but many important verbs are irregular (lost/done/written etc.).

When we say that 'something has happened', this is usually new information:
Ow! I've cut my finger

When we use the present perfect, there is a connection with now. The action in the past has a result now:
‘Where's your key?' 'I don't know. I've lost it.' (= I don't have it now)

You can use the present perfect with just, already and yet.
Just = a short time ago:
‘Are you hungry?' ‘No, I've just had lunch
We use already to say that something happened sooner than expected:
O ‘Don't forget to pay your electricity bill' ‘I've already paid it.
Yet = until now. Yet shows that the speaker is expecting something to happen. Use yet only in
questions and negative sentences:
Has it stopped raining yet?

You can also use the past simple (did, went, had etc.) in the examples on this page. So you can say:
‘Is Sally here?' ‘No, she went out.' or 'No, she's gone out

When we taLk about a period of time that continues from the past until now, we use the present
perfect (have been / have travelled etc.). Here, Dave and Jane are talking about the places Jane
has visited in her life, which is a period that continues until now.
