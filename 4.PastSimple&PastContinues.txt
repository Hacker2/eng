2. The past of be (am/is/are) is was/were:
l/he/she/it was/wasn't we/you/they were/weren't
was l/he/she/it? were we/you/they?

I was angry yesterday
I was not angry today morning
Where were you hour ago?


Past continues:
They were playing = they were in the middle of playing.
They had not finished playing.
Was/were -ing is the past continuous:
l/he/she/it was
we/you/they were
playing
doing
working etc.

I was doing something = I was in the middle of doing something at a certain time. The action or
situation had already started before this time, but had not finished:
I was reading book when he called
I was not reading book when he called
What was I reading when he called

2. Compare the past con tinuous (I was doing) and past simple (t did):
Past continuous (in the middle of an action)
I was walking home when I met Dan
Past simple (complete action)
I walked home after the party last night

3. We often use the past simple and the past continuous together to say that something happened in the
middle of something else
Matt phoned while we were having dinner

When Karen arrived, we were having
dinner. (= we had already started
before she arrived)
When Karen arrived, we had dinner.
(= Karen arrived, and then we had
dinner)

Some verbs (for example, know and want) are not normally used in the continuous
We were good friends. We knew each other well
